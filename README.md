# Recommendation-System-Yelp

This project focuses on analyzing Yelp restaurant reviews using MongoDB. I import a subset of Yelp data, model it for efficient querying, and develop a recommendation engine to suggest restaurants based on user preferences, social influences, and review analysis. 
The code includes Python scripts for data import, MongoDB queries, and a recommendation engine, along with a report detailing the process and results.
